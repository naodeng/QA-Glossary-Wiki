They must:Reviewthe change request to understand the new requirements or modifications.Assessthe impact on existing test cases and the need for new ones.Updateorcreatetest cases and scripts to cover the changes.Executeregression tests to ensure that changes have not introduced new defects.Communicatewith the development team to clarify requirements and discuss potential risks.Documenttest results and any new defects found as a result of the change.Participatein re-assessment of the project timeline and resource allocation, if necessary.Testers must beproactiveandadaptive, ready to modify their approach based on the nature and extent of the changes. They should leverageautomation toolsto quickly re-run affectedtest casesand ensure comprehensive coverage. Effective handling ofchange requestsby testers is crucial to maintainingsoftware qualityand project timelines.
- How can change requests impact the test plan?Change requestscan significantly impact atest planby necessitating updates totest cases,test scripts, andtest data. When a change request is approved, it may introduce new features, modify existing functionality, or fix defects, all of which require thetest planto be revisited to ensure coverage.Test Cases: New or updated requirements mean test cases must be reviewed and potentially rewritten or new ones added to cover the changes.Test Scripts: Automated test scripts may need to be modified to align with the new requirements. This could involve changing selectors, adding new steps, or updating validation points.Test Data: Changes in the application logic might require different test data to be created to adequately test the new or changed functionality.Execution Schedule: The timeline for testing may be affected, with additional time needed to accommodate the changes. This could lead to a re-prioritization of test activities.Resource Allocation: More or different resources (human or infrastructure) might be required to handle the updated testing workload.Risk Analysis: The test plan's risk assessment must be updated to reflect any new risks introduced by the changes.Automated testingframeworks and continuous integration systems may need to be adjusted to incorporate these changes. For example:// Before change request
test('verify login', async () => {
  await page.type('#username', 'user1');
  await page.type('#password', 'pass1');
  await page.click('#login-button');
  expect(await page.find('.welcome-message').textContent).toBe('Welcome, user1!');
});

// After change request
test('verify login with OTP', async () => {
  await page.type('#username', 'user2');
  await page.type('#password', 'pass2');
  await page.click('#login-button');
  // New step for OTP
  await page.type('#otp', '123456');
  await page.click('#otp-submit');
  expect(await page.find('.welcome-message').textContent).toBe('Welcome, user2!');
});Adapting tochange requestsis a dynamic process that requirestest automationengineers to be flexible and responsive to ensure thetest planremains effective and relevant.

- Useversion controlto track changes in test scripts alongside application code.
- Implementrobust loggingto quickly identify and fix issues that arise due to changes.
- Prioritizetest maintenanceas part of the sprint to keep the automation suite reliable.

Testers play a critical role inhandlingchange requestsby ensuring that the modifications do not adversely affect the existing functionality and that the new requirements are met. They must:
**handlingchange requests**[change requests](/wiki/change-requests)- Reviewthe change request to understand the new requirements or modifications.
- Assessthe impact on existing test cases and the need for new ones.
- Updateorcreatetest cases and scripts to cover the changes.
- Executeregression tests to ensure that changes have not introduced new defects.
- Communicatewith the development team to clarify requirements and discuss potential risks.
- Documenttest results and any new defects found as a result of the change.
- Participatein re-assessment of the project timeline and resource allocation, if necessary.

- Test Scripts: Automated test scripts may need to be modified to align with the new requirements. This could involve changing selectors, adding new steps, or updating validation points.
- Test Data: Changes in the application logic might require different test data to be created to adequately test the new or changed functionality.
- Execution Schedule: The timeline for testing may be affected, with additional time needed to accommodate the changes. This could lead to a re-prioritization of test activities.
- Resource Allocation: More or different resources (human or infrastructure) might be required to handle the updated testing workload.
- Risk Analysis: The test plan's risk assessment must be updated to reflect any new risks introduced by the changes.

Automated testingframeworks and continuous integration systems may need to be adjusted to incorporate these changes. For example:
[Automated testing](/wiki/automated-testing)
```
// Before change request
test('verify login', async () => {
  await page.type('#username', 'user1');
  await page.type('#password', 'pass1');
  await page.click('#login-button');
  expect(await page.find('.welcome-message').textContent).toBe('Welcome, user1!');
});

// After change request
test('verify login with OTP', async () => {
  await page.type('#username', 'user2');
  await page.type('#password', 'pass2');
  await page.click('#login-button');
  // New step for OTP
  await page.type('#otp', '123456');
  await page.click('#otp-submit');
  expect(await page.find('.welcome-message').textContent).toBe('Welcome, user2!');
});
```
`// Before change request
test('verify login', async () => {
  await page.type('#username', 'user1');
  await page.type('#password', 'pass1');
  await page.click('#login-button');
  expect(await page.find('.welcome-message').textContent).toBe('Welcome, user1!');
});

// After change request
test('verify login with OTP', async () => {
  await page.type('#username', 'user2');
  await page.type('#password', 'pass2');
  await page.click('#login-button');
  // New step for OTP
  await page.type('#otp', '123456');
  await page.click('#otp-submit');
  expect(await page.find('.welcome-message').textContent).toBe('Welcome, user2!');
});`
Adapting tochange requestsis a dynamic process that requirestest automationengineers to be flexible and responsive to ensure thetest planremains effective and relevant.
[change requests](/wiki/change-requests)[test automation](/wiki/test-automation)[test plan](/wiki/test-plan)
Testers shouldadapt their strategiesto accommodatechange requestsby:
**adapt their strategies**[change requests](/wiki/change-requests)- Reviewingthe change request thoroughly to understand its implications on the existing test cases.
- Updatingthetest planandtest casesto align with the new requirements, ensuring that new functionalities are covered and obsolete tests are removed or modified.
- Prioritizingtest cases based on the risk and impact of the change, focusing on critical areas first.
- Automatingregression tests to quickly validate that existing functionalities are not adversely affected by the changes.
- Communicatingwith the development team to clarify requirements and understand the technical aspects of the change.
- Executingasubset of testsrelated to the changed areas to ensure a targeted and efficient testing approach.
- Maintaininga flexible and modular test automation framework that allows for easy updates and integration of new tests.
- Versioningtest scripts and using source control to manage changes in the test codebase.
- Monitoringthe effectiveness of the updated tests and making further adjustments as necessary based on feedback and test results.
