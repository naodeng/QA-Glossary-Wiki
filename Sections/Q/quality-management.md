Quality Assurance(QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two distinct processes withinQuality Management.QAis a proactive process that focuses on preventing defects by ensuring that the processes used to manage and create deliverables are adequate for the task. It is process-oriented and encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, aiming to improve development and test processes so that defects do not arise when the product is being developed.
[Quality Assurance](/wiki/quality-assurance)[Quality Management](/wiki/quality-management)**QA**
On the other hand,QCis a reactive process, which means it operates by identifying and correcting defects in the actual products produced. It is product-oriented and involves the execution of actual testing on the software to verify that it meets the specified requirements and standards. QC activities includesystem testing,integration testing, andunit testing, which are often automated intest automationscenarios.
**QC**[system testing](/wiki/system-testing)[integration testing](/wiki/integration-testing)[unit testing](/wiki/unit-testing)[test automation](/wiki/test-automation)
In essence, QA is aboutbuilding the right processto create a quality product, while QC is aboutensuring the product built is rightby verifying its quality after production. QA aims to prevent defects with a focus on the process used to make the product, whereas QC aims to identify and fix defects in the finished product. Both are crucial for delivering a high-quality software product, but they address quality from different angles and at different stages of the product lifecycle.
**building the right process****ensuring the product built is right**
Quality Assurance(QA) supportsQuality Management(QM) by ensuring that the processes used to manage and create deliverables are effective and efficient. QA functions as a preventive strategy, focusing on the improvement of the software development process. It aims to prevent defects by concentrating on the process used to make the product.
[Quality Assurance](/wiki/quality-assurance)[Quality Management](/wiki/quality-management)
QA activities include process definition and implementation, training, process documentation, and process improvement initiatives. By establishing and maintaining a set of standards and methodologies for development and testing, QA helps in reducing variability in the processes, which can lead to higher quality products.

Test automationengineers benefit from QA through the establishment of stable and repeatable development cycles.Automated testing, as part of QA, ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality, thus maintaining the integrity of the software.
