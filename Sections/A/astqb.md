#### How is ASTQB different from ISTQB?

  [ASTQB](../A/astqb.md), or the American [Software Testing](../S/software-testing.md) Qualifications Board, is the United States board for the International [Software Testing](../S/software-testing.md) Qualifications Board ([ISTQB](../I/istqb.md)). While both [ASTQB](../A/astqb.md) and [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md) offer similar certification programs for software testers, the key difference lies in their geographical focus and regional influence.
  **[ASTQB](../A/astqb.md)** provides certifications that are tailored to the American work environment and culture, and it may offer additional services or support specific to the United States. For instance, [ASTQB](../A/astqb.md) might include localized content in their exams or provide networking opportunities within the U.S.
  **[ISTQB](../I/istqb.md)**, on the other hand, is a more global entity with member boards in various countries. Certifications obtained through [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md) are recognized internationally and not specific to any single country.
  For professionals working or intending to work in the U.S., [ASTQB](../A/astqb.md) certification might be more recognized by American employers. However, for those seeking international opportunities, [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md) certification could be more beneficial due to its global acceptance.
  Both boards maintain a syllabus that is largely aligned, ensuring that the core principles and practices of [software testing](../S/software-testing.md) are consistent. The certifications from both [ASTQB](../A/astqb.md) and [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md) are interchangeable in many cases, meaning that a certification from one board is often recognized by the other.
  In summary, while [ASTQB](../A/astqb.md) and [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md) share a common goal of standardizing the knowledge and skills of software testers, [ASTQB](../A/astqb.md) caters more specifically to the U.S. market, whereas [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md) has a broader, international reach.
