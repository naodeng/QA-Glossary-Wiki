Update a variable: Change the value of an existing variable during the execution of scripts.
**Update a variable**
```
pm.environment.set("user_id", 12345);
```
`pm.environment.set("user_id", 12345);`
Clear a variable: Remove the value of a variable, making it undefined.
**Clear a variable**

Variables inPostmanare scoped hierarchically, allowing you to define them at global, collection, environment, and local (data file) levels. This flexibility enables you to maintain different sets of values for different testing scenarios and stages. Remember to use meaningful names for your variables to maintain clarity and readability in your requests and scripts.

#### Advanced Features
- How do you use Postman for automated testing?To automate testing withPostman, follow these steps:Create a collection: Group related API requests into a collection.Write tests: For each request, write tests in the Tests tab using JavaScript and Postman's pm object. Example:pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});Use environment variables: Set up environment variables for dynamic data in your requests and tests.Chain requests: Usepm.sendRequestto chain requests and use the response of one request as input for another.Run collections: Use the Collection Runner to execute all requests in a collection. Optionally, select an environment and specify iterations and delays.View results: After running, analyze the results in the Collection Runner for passed and failed tests.Automate with Newman: Install Newman, Postman's command-line companion, to run collections outside of Postman. Use the following command:newman run <Collection URL> -e <Environment URL>Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate Newman into your CI/CD pipeline using appropriate commands in your build scripts or configuration files.By automating tests inPostman, you can ensure yourAPIbehaves as expected after changes, and you can integrate these tests into your development workflows for continuous testing.
- What is the Postman Collection Runner and how do you use it?ThePostmanCollection Runneris a tool withinPostmanthat allows you to execute multipleAPIrequests in a specified sequence. It's particularly useful for running tests across a collection of endpoints, simulating workflows, or performing smoke testing.To use the Collection Runner:Open Postman and select the collection you want to run.Click on theRunnerbutton at the bottom left of the Postman window.In the Collection Runner window, choose the collection and the environment (if you use environment variables).Configure options such as iterations, delay between requests, and log responses.Optionally, select a data file if you want to run the collection with different sets of data (data-driven testing).Click on theRun [collection name]button to start the execution.As the Collection Runner executes the requests, it displays real-time results including passed/failed tests, response times, and log outputs. You can use this feedback to debug and optimize yourAPIrequests and tests.For automation, you can trigger Collection Runner via the command line using Newman,Postman's companion tool for running collections outside of thePostmanapp. This is particularly useful for integrating with CI/CD pipelines.newman run <Collection URL or Path> -e <Environment File Path>Remember to leveragescriptsin your collections to enhance the automation capabilities, such as setting up pre-request scripts or tests that will run with each request in the runner.
- How do you use Postman's scripting capabilities?Postman's scripting capabilities are leveraged through thePre-request ScriptandTeststabs within a request. These scripts are written in JavaScript and allow you to programmatically interact with request and response data.Pre-request Script: Execute JavaScript before a request runs. Use it to set up variables, parameters, or headers. For example:pm.variables.set("timestamp", Date.now());Tests: Write test assertions to validate response data, status codes, and response times after a request is sent.Postmanuses the Chai assertion library. Example:pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response time is less than 500ms", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);
});Dynamic Variables: Generate random data for requests using dynamic variables like{{$randomInt}}.Data Files: Use external data files in JSON or CSV format to run iterative tests with different sets of data.pm.API*: Access a wide range ofPostman-specific objects and functions to interact with the environment, collection, and request/response details.Snippets: Quickly add common script snippets from the right-hand sidebar to speed up test writing.Console: Debug scripts by logging output to thePostmanConsole (View>Show Postman Console).Global/Environment Variables: Scripts can create, modify, or delete global and environment variables to maintain state between requests.Combine these scripting features with theCollection RunnerorPostmanMonitorsto execute automatedtest suitesand monitorAPIsat scheduled intervals.
- What is Postman Monitors and how does it work?PostmanMonitors are automated processes that run collections at scheduled intervals to check for the performance and response ofAPIs. They work by executing a collection, which is a set of pre-defined requests, and can be set to run on various environments, ensuring thatAPIsare functioning as expected over time.To set up a monitor, you select a collection, configure the frequency of the run, and specify the environment. Monitors can run as often as every 5 minutes or on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. When a monitor runs, it executes each request in the collection and reports on the results.Monitors are useful for:Continuous Monitoring: Ensuring that your API is up and running at all times.Version Checks: Validating that the latest deployment hasn't broken any existing functionality.Response Time Alerts: Notifying when APIs are responding slower than expected, which could indicate performance issues.Results from monitors can be viewed in thePostmanapp or web dashboard, where you can see the history of runs, response times, and the details of any failures. You can also set up integrations to receive notifications via email, Slack, or other platforms when a monitor fails or detects issues.Here's a basic example of how to set up a monitor usingPostman'sAPI:POST /monitors
{
  "name": "API Health Check",
  "collection_uid": "12345-abcdef",
  "environment_uid": "98765-fedcba",
  "schedule": {
    "interval": 10,
    "unit": "minutes"
  }
}This would create a monitor named "APIHealth Check" that runs every 10 minutes using the specified collection and environment.
- How do you use Postman for performance testing?To usePostmanforperformance testing, you'll primarily leverage theCollection RunnerandPostmanMonitors. Here's a concise guide:Create a Collection: Group all the requests you want to test under a single collection.Write Pre-request andTest Scripts: Customize your requests and responses handling using JavaScript in the Pre-request and Tests tabs.Set Variables: Use environment or collection variables to simulate different scenarios and data sets.Run Collection: Use the Collection Runner to execute the entire collection. Adjust theiterationsand delay between requests to simulate load.// Example of setting a variable in pre-request script
pm.variables.set("dynamicValue", Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));Analyze Results: After the run, review response times, error rates, and other important metrics to assess performance.Monitor Performance: Set up aPostmanMonitor to run your collection at regular intervals, which helps in tracking performance over time.Integrate with CI/CD: UsePostman's Newman command-line tool to integrate your performance tests into your CI/CD pipeline for regular feedback.Scale with Cloud Agents: For more extensiveperformance testing, usePostman's cloud agents to simulate higher loads and more realistic conditions.Remember, whilePostmancan handle basicperformance testing, it's not a substitute for dedicatedperformance testingtools likeJMeteror LoadRunner when it comes to complexload testingscenarios. UsePostmanfor lightweight performance checks andAPIendpointstress testing.

- Comments: Add comments on collections or requests for communication and feedback within the team.
- Forking and Merging: Fork collections to experiment or make changes without affecting the team's main collection. Merge changes back when ready.
- Integrations: ConnectPostmanwith version control systems like GitHub for syncing and backup ofPostmancollections.
- Monitoring: Set up monitors on collections to regularly run tests and share results with the team.
- APIDocumentation: Automatically generate and shareAPIdocumentation with your team or stakeholders for better collaboration.
