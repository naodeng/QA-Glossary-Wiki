Both are crucial for standardizing practices and improving communication in the field of [software testing](../S/software-testing.md), but [BS 7925-2](../B/bs-7925-2.md) is more directly involved with the practical application of those terms and concepts in the creation and execution of tests.

### Terminology

#### What is the meaning of 'test case' in BS 7925-2?

  In [BS 7925-2](../B/bs-7925-2.md), a **[test case](../T/test-case.md)** is defined as a set of *input values*, *execution preconditions*, *expected results*, and *postconditions*, developed for a particular objective or test condition, such as to exercise a particular program path or to verify compliance with a specific requirement.
  [Test cases](../T/test-case.md) are fundamental to the testing process as they describe the conditions under which a test will be executed and the expected outcome to determine if the software behaves as intended. Each [test case](../T/test-case.md) should be uniquely identifiable and include sufficient detail to allow for its execution and assessment of whether the software passes or fails the test.
  For automation, [test cases](../T/test-case.md) are typically scripted and managed by testing frameworks or tools that can execute them against the software under test and report outcomes. The precision and detail in a [test case](../T/test-case.md) directly influence the effectiveness and repeatability of automated tests.

#### What is the meaning of 'test procedure' in BS 7925-2?

  In [BS 7925-2](../B/bs-7925-2.md), a **test procedure** is defined as a set of instructions for the execution of a test. It details the sequence of actions for carrying out the test, including the [setup](../S/setup.md) of test preconditions, the input of [test cases](../T/test-case.md), and the recording of test results. Essentially, it's the **how-to** for executing a [test case](../T/test-case.md) or a set of [test cases](../T/test-case.md) within a [test suite](../T/test-suite.md).
  Test procedures are crucial for ensuring that tests are repeatable and consistent across different test cycles and environments. They help in maintaining the integrity of the testing process by providing a clear, step-by-step guide that testers can follow. This is particularly important in automation, where precise instructions are necessary for scripts to perform correctly.
  Here's an example of what a simple test procedure might look like in pseudocode:

  ```
  // Test Procedure for Login Functionality
  setUpTestEnvironment();
  navigateToLoginPage();
  enterUsername("testUser");
  enterPassword("testPass");
  clickLoginButton();
  verifyLoginSuccess();
  tearDownTestEnvironment();
  ```
  This example outlines the basic steps an automated script would follow to test a login functionality. Each step would be elaborated upon in a detailed test procedure, ensuring that the automation script behaves as expected and that the [test cases](../T/test-case.md) are executed correctly.

#### What is the meaning of 'test suite' in BS 7925-2?

  In the context of **[BS 7925-2](../B/bs-7925-2.md)**, a *test suite* refers to a **collection of [test cases](../T/test-case.md)** that are designed to be executed together to validate the behavior of a particular software feature or ensure compliance with a specific requirement. [Test suites](../T/test-suite.md) are organized to efficiently manage and execute multiple [test cases](../T/test-case.md), often sharing [setup](../S/setup.md) and teardown procedures, and are used to assess whether a test item meets the intended quality standards. [Test suites](../T/test-suite.md) can be tailored to test different aspects of the software, such as functionality, performance, or security, and can be executed manually or automated for efficiency and consistency.

#### What is the meaning of 'test item' in BS 7925-2?

  In [BS 7925-2](../B/bs-7925-2.md), a **test item** refers to the individual element of software or system that is the subject of testing. It can be a component, module, function, or any other isolatable part of the software that can be verified for correctness against specified requirements or to detect defects. Test items are selected based on the test level and the scope of testing, and they are the building blocks upon which [test cases](../T/test-case.md) and test procedures are designed and executed. Identifying test items is a critical step in the test design process, ensuring that all parts of the software are adequately covered by tests.

#### What is the meaning of 'test level' in BS 7925-2?

  In [BS 7925-2](../B/bs-7925-2.md), the term **test level** refers to the specific stage in the software development lifecycle at which testing occurs. Each level corresponds to a particular phase in the development process and is aimed at evaluating different aspects of the software product. The standard recognizes multiple levels of testing, such as [unit testing](../U/unit-testing.md), [integration testing](../I/integration-testing.md), [system testing](../S/system-testing.md), and [acceptance testing](../A/acceptance-testing.md).

  - **[Unit Testing](../U/unit-testing.md)** : Focuses on individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
  - **[Integration Testing](../I/integration-testing.md)** : Tests the interactions between integrated units or components to detect interface defects.
  - **[System Testing](../S/system-testing.md)** : Validates the complete and integrated software product to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
  - **[Acceptance Testing](../A/acceptance-testing.md)** : Conducted to enable a user, customer, or other authorized entity to determine whether to accept the system.
  Each level is designed to identify specific types of defects that are relevant to that stage of development. By defining test levels, [BS 7925-2](../B/bs-7925-2.md) helps structure the testing process, making it more systematic and efficient. [Test automation](../T/test-automation.md) engineers can apply this concept to organize automated tests that align with the development stages, ensuring that tests are run at the appropriate level and that the software is thoroughly evaluated before release.

  - **[Unit Testing](../U/unit-testing.md)** : Focuses on individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
  - **[Integration Testing](../I/integration-testing.md)** : Tests the interactions between integrated units or components to detect interface defects.
