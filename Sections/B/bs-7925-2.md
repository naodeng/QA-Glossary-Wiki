#### Terminology
- What is the meaning of 'test case' in BS 7925-2?InBS 7925-2, atest caseis defined as a set ofinput values,execution preconditions,expected results, andpostconditions, developed for a particular objective or test condition, such as to exercise a particular program path or to verify compliance with a specific requirement.Test casesare fundamental to the testing process as they describe the conditions under which a test will be executed and the expected outcome to determine if the software behaves as intended. Eachtest caseshould be uniquely identifiable and include sufficient detail to allow for its execution and assessment of whether the software passes or fails the test.For automation,test casesare typically scripted and managed by testing frameworks or tools that can execute them against the software under test and report outcomes. The precision and detail in atest casedirectly influence the effectiveness and repeatability of automated tests.
- What is the meaning of 'test procedure' in BS 7925-2?InBS 7925-2, atest procedureis defined as a set of instructions for the execution of a test. It details the sequence of actions for carrying out the test, including thesetupof test preconditions, the input oftest cases, and the recording of test results. Essentially, it's thehow-tofor executing atest caseor a set oftest caseswithin atest suite.Test procedures are crucial for ensuring that tests are repeatable and consistent across different test cycles and environments. They help in maintaining the integrity of the testing process by providing a clear, step-by-step guide that testers can follow. This is particularly important in automation, where precise instructions are necessary for scripts to perform correctly.Here's an example of what a simple test procedure might look like in pseudocode:// Test Procedure for Login Functionality
setUpTestEnvironment();
navigateToLoginPage();
enterUsername("testUser");
enterPassword("testPass");
clickLoginButton();
verifyLoginSuccess();
tearDownTestEnvironment();This example outlines the basic steps an automated script would follow to test a login functionality. Each step would be elaborated upon in a detailed test procedure, ensuring that the automation script behaves as expected and that thetest casesare executed correctly.
- What is the meaning of 'test suite' in BS 7925-2?In the context ofBS 7925-2, atest suiterefers to acollection oftest casesthat are designed to be executed together to validate the behavior of a particular software feature or ensure compliance with a specific requirement.Test suitesare organized to efficiently manage and execute multipletest cases, often sharingsetupand teardown procedures, and are used to assess whether a test item meets the intended quality standards.Test suitescan be tailored to test different aspects of the software, such as functionality, performance, or security, and can be executed manually or automated for efficiency and consistency.
- What is the meaning of 'test item' in BS 7925-2?InBS 7925-2, atest itemrefers to the individual element of software or system that is the subject of testing. It can be a component, module, function, or any other isolatable part of the software that can be verified for correctness against specified requirements or to detect defects. Test items are selected based on the test level and the scope of testing, and they are the building blocks upon whichtest casesand test procedures are designed and executed. Identifying test items is a critical step in the test design process, ensuring that all parts of the software are adequately covered by tests.
