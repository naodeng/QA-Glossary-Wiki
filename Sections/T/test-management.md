#### Basics and Importance
- What is test management in software testing?Test managementinsoftware testingis the process of overseeing and coordinating the various activities involved in the testing phase. It encompasses the organization, control, and documentation necessary to ensure that testing is systematic, repeatable, and effective. This includes defining the test objectives, selecting appropriate testing methodologies, managing test artifacts liketest casesand scenarios, and ensuring that all testing activities align with the project goals and timelines.Effectivetest managementfacilitates clear communication among team members and stakeholders, enabling better decision-making and risk management. It also ensures thattest coverageis comprehensive and that the testing process is efficient and cost-effective.Test managers typically use specialized tools to streamline these processes. These tools offer functionalities such astest casecreation and maintenance,test executiontracking, defect tracking, and reporting capabilities.
