### Integration with Other Processes

#### How does test management integrate with requirements management?

  [Test management](../T/test-management.md) and requirements management are closely intertwined in ensuring that software meets its specified needs. By integrating these two processes, teams can achieve traceability, which is the ability to link [test cases](../T/test-case.md) to their corresponding requirements.
  **Traceability** ensures that all requirements have associated [test cases](../T/test-case.md), which helps in validating that each requirement is covered by tests and works as expected. This linkage allows for:

  - **[Impact Analysis](../I/impact-analysis.md)** : When requirements change, traceability helps identify which test cases need to be updated or re-executed.
  - **Coverage Analysis** : Teams can assess whether the testing efforts cover all requirements and identify any gaps.
  - **Prioritization** : Tests can be prioritized based on the importance and risk of their associated requirements.
  - **[Verification](../V/verification.md) and Validation** : Ensures that the software fulfills its intended purpose without defects.
  Integration is typically achieved through [test management](../T/test-management.md) tools that offer functionalities to map [test cases](../T/test-case.md) to requirements. These tools often provide visual aids, such as graphs or matrices, to display the relationships and coverage status.
  In practice, when a requirement is added or modified, the [test management](../T/test-management.md) system can automatically notify the relevant stakeholders. [Test cases](../T/test-case.md) can then be reviewed and adjusted accordingly, maintaining alignment between the evolving requirements and the [test suite](../T/test-suite.md).
  By fostering a collaborative environment, this integration supports a more efficient and effective testing process, leading to higher quality software and a more streamlined development lifecycle.

  - **[Impact Analysis](../I/impact-analysis.md)** : When requirements change, traceability helps identify which test cases need to be updated or re-executed.

#### How does test management integrate with defect management?

  [Test management](../T/test-management.md) and [defect management](../D/defect-management.md) are **intertwined** processes in [software testing](../S/software-testing.md). [Test management](../T/test-management.md) focuses on planning, monitoring, and controlling the testing activities, while [defect management](../D/defect-management.md) deals with identifying, documenting, and tracking defects to resolution.
  Integration between the two is achieved through:

  - **Linking [test cases](../T/test-case.md) to defects** : When a test case fails, a defect is logged. The test management tool should allow linking the defect directly to the test case, providing traceability and making it easier to retest once the defect is resolved.
  - **Status synchronization** : The status of the defect should reflect in the test case status. If a defect is fixed, the linked test cases should be flagged for retesting.
  - **Reporting and metrics** : Integrated tools can generate comprehensive reports that include both test and defect metrics, offering insights into quality and progress.
  - **Collaboration** : Teams can collaborate more effectively when they have visibility into both testing and defect management activities. Comments, attachments, and history logs should be shared across both systems.
  Tools that support this integration typically offer features like:

  ```
  - Automated defect creation from failed tests
  - Customizable workflows for defects and test cases
  - Shared dashboards and reporting tools
  - Real-time notifications and updates
  ```
