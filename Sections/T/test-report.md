- How often should a Test Report be updated or revised?ATest Reportshould be updated or revisedafter each significant test run. This typically aligns with the completion of a testing cycle, such as a sprint oriterationin Agile methodologies, or after executing a critical set oftest cases. For continuous integration environments, this may mean updating the reportafter every automated build and test cycle.The frequency of updates also depends on theproject phase. During active development, reports might be updated more frequently, evendaily, to reflect the rapid changes and fixes. As the project stabilizes, updates might shift to aweeklyorbi-weeklyschedule.In cases where test results impact immediate decisions, such as hotfixes or high-prioritybugs, update the reportas soon as the relevant tests are executedto ensure timely communication.For long-running performance tests or security audits, update the report upon completion of the tests, which could span over several days or weeks.In summary, update theTest Report:After each significant test runor testing cycle.Dailyduring active development phases.Weekly/Bi-weeklyas the project stabilizes.Immediatelyfor tests impacting urgent decisions.Upon completionfor long-running tests.Remember to highlightnew findings,regressions, andfixverificationsclearly, and ensure the report reflects the most current understanding of the software's quality.
