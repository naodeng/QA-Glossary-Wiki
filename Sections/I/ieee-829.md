  - **Test techniques** : The methods and approach that will be used to derive the test cases.
  - **Test identification** : A naming convention or identifier for each test case.
  - **Feature pass/fail criteria** : The criteria that will determine if a feature has passed or failed the tests.

#### How does the IEEE 829 standard define a test case specification?

  In the [IEEE 829](../I/ieee-829.md) standard, a **[test case](../T/test-case.md) specification** is defined as a document that specifies both the **inputs** and **[expected results](../E/expected-result.md)** for a set of test conditions. This specification is derived from the [test design specification](../T/test-design-specification.md) and is used to ensure that a [test case](../T/test-case.md) can be executed to validate a particular requirement or part of the system under test.
  Each [test case](../T/test-case.md) specification typically includes:

  - **[Test case](../T/test-case.md) identifier** : A unique identifier for the test case.
  - **Test items** : The items or features to be tested.
  - **Input specifications** : Detailed description of the inputs, including data and setup necessary to execute the test.
  - **Output specifications** : The expected results that should occur given the inputs.
  - **Execution conditions** : Any prerequisites or conditions that must be met before the test is executed.
  - **Special procedural requirements** : Any specific steps or procedures that must be followed during test execution.
  - **Intercase dependencies** : Information about how this test case is related to others, if applicable.
  The purpose of the [test case](../T/test-case.md) specification is to provide a clear, concise, and complete description of the steps necessary to verify that the software meets its design requirements. It serves as a guide for testers to execute tests and record results in a consistent and repeatable manner.

  - **[Test case](../T/test-case.md) identifier** : A unique identifier for the test case.
  - **Test items** : The items or features to be tested.
  - **Input specifications** : Detailed description of the inputs, including data and setup necessary to execute the test.
  - **Output specifications** : The expected results that should occur given the inputs.
  - **Execution conditions** : Any prerequisites or conditions that must be met before the test is executed.
  - **Special procedural requirements** : Any specific steps or procedures that must be followed during test execution.
  - **Intercase dependencies** : Information about how this test case is related to others, if applicable.

#### What is the role of a test procedure specification in the IEEE 829 standard?

  In the [IEEE 829](../I/ieee-829.md) standard, a **test procedure specification** details the sequence of actions for executing a test. It includes the steps to set up the [test environment](../T/test-environment.md), the order of [test execution](../T/test-execution.md), and the procedure for logging results and finalizing the test. This specification acts as a script for testers to follow, ensuring consistency and repeatability in testing.
  Test procedure specifications are derived from **[test cases](../T/test-case.md)** and **[test design specifications](../T/test-design-specification.md)**. They translate the test conditions and outcomes defined in the [test design specification](../T/test-design-specification.md) into clear, executable instructions. This includes specifying any **[test data](../T/test-data.md)** to be used, the **[expected results](../E/expected-result.md)**, and the **post-test cleanup** activities.
  The specification is crucial for automation as it guides the development of scripts and the configuration of tools. It ensures that automated tests are executed in a manner consistent with the [test strategy](../T/test-strategy.md) and that they yield meaningful, comparable results.
  Here's an example of what a test procedure might look like in pseudocode:

  ```
  // Test Procedure for Login Functionality
  SETUP:
    - Initialize browser and navigate to login page.
  EXECUTE:
    - Enter valid username and password.
    - Click the login button.
  VERIFY:
    - Check if the user is redirected to the dashboard.
    - Validate that a welcome message is displayed.
  TEARDOWN:
    - Log out and close the browser.
  ```
  By detailing the exact steps, the test procedure specification helps maintain the integrity of the testing process and provides a clear basis for evaluating the system under test.

### Comparison and Evaluation

#### How does the IEEE 829 standard compare to other software testing standards?

  The **[IEEE 829](../I/ieee-829.md) standard**, also known as the **Standard for Software and System Test Documentation**, is a set of guidelines for creating test documentation. When compared to other [software testing](../S/software-testing.md) standards, [IEEE 829](../I/ieee-829.md) is particularly **documentation-centric**. It provides a structured approach to documenting the testing process, including specific templates and instructions for creating various test documents.
  Other standards, such as **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119**, offer a broader scope, encompassing not just documentation but also processes, techniques, and methodologies for [software testing](../S/software-testing.md). ISO 29119 aims to provide a universal framework for [software testing](../S/software-testing.md), compatible with other standards like **Agile**, **DevOps**, and regulatory requirements.
  **[ISTQB](../I/istqb.md)** (International [Software Testing](../S/software-testing.md) Qualifications Board) certifications and guidelines focus on the knowledge and skills necessary for [software testing](../S/software-testing.md) professionals. While [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md) does not provide a standard per se, it offers a comprehensive body of knowledge (syllabus) and competency guidelines for testers at various levels.
  In contrast, [IEEE 829](../I/ieee-829.md) is more prescriptive about the **specific artifacts** to be produced during the testing process, which can be seen as both a strength and a limitation. It is strong in ensuring thorough documentation but may be less flexible than other standards in adapting to modern, iterative development methodologies that favor lighter-weight documentation.
  In summary, [IEEE 829](../I/ieee-829.md) is a detailed, artifact-driven standard that contrasts with broader, process-oriented standards like ISO 29119 and the knowledge-based guidelines provided by [ISTQB](../I/istqb.md).
